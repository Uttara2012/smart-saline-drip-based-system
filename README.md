Saline, one of the most popular intravenous (IV) therapy plays a major role in the management of patients who are critically ill. Surveillance of saline bottle level is very important because when the bottle is emptied and the needle is not removed from the vein then the blood flows outward into the bottle. In hospitals, the nurses or caretakers are responsible for monitoring the saline bottle level. Mostly, due to negligence and any unusual condition, the exact timing of removing the needle from the patient's vein is ignored which causes a serious casualty and may lead to death as well. Furthermore, remote monitoring is a need to provide telehealth services. To prevent the accident due to the ignorance of caretakers and to provide remote surveillance in telehealth services, we have proposed the cost-effective smart saline level monitoring device which includes the combination of sensor and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies.
